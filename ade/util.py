    is 0) of a hashable argument to L{run} that serves as an ID for
    the function part, uniquely identifies one flavor of a call to it
    for the overall evaluation.

    For example, consider an evaluation function that involves calling
    the same callable C{f} three times with a different integer ID as
    the first argument followed by an array of parameter values. You
    would set I{k} to 0, since the first argument is the unique ID.
