"""
C{pv}: Parses a data file containing a pickled L{History} object,
which gets produced when you call L{Population.save} with the file
path.

This is very handy for seeing whether you have to redefine bounds for
any of your parameters. It is often useful to tighten bounds for
particular problems. Or you might need to loosen things up if you see
the values for a given parameter crowding onto one bound or the other.

Specify the data file for the pickled Population object with the first
argument.

    """
    ADE Parameter Viewer.

    Provides two different types of plots for visualizing the
    parameters in your Population: (1) the parameter values vs SSE,
    and (2) most highly correlated parameter values vs each other,
    with greater emphasis on parameter value pairs with lower SSE.
    
    The first and possibly only positional argument is the path of a
    data file containing a pickled History object, produced from
    calling Population.save with the file path.

    Any additional positional arguments must be names of parameters to
    limit the plotting to. If none are supplied, all parameters will
    be plotted. This is usually what you'll wind up doing.

    The -r and -i options only apply to parameter value vs SSE plots,
    not to correlation plots. If -r is not specified, no such plots
    will be included.

    The -N option only applies to parameter correlation plots, which
    will not be included if -N is not specified. A recommended value
    of N is 4. (If you have more highly correlated parameters than
    that, you should rethink your model.
