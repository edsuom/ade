"""
A L{Population} class and helpers.

What you'll need to be concerned with is mostly constructing an
instance, setting it up, and passing it to
L{de.DifferentialEvolution}. The constructor requires an evaluation
function, parameter names, and parameter bounds. You'll need to wait
for the C{Deferred} that L{Population.setup} returns before
proceeding.

    2-tuples that each define the lower and upper limits of the
    values:

        - I{func}: A callable to which an L{Individual} can send its
          parameter values and from which it receives a sum-of-squared
          error float value as a result.

        - I{names}: A sequence of parameter names.

        - I{bounds}: A list of 2-tuples, one for each parameter
          name. The first element of each tuple is the lower bound of
          a parameter in the second the upper bound.

    The callable I{func} must accept a single 1-D Numpy array as its
    sole argument and return the sum of squared errors (SSE) as a
    single float value. To shut down I{ade}, it can return a negative
    SSE value. If I{ade} is shutting down, it will use I{None} as the
    argument, and the callable should act accordingly.
    
    @keyword constraints: A list of callables that enforce any
        constraints on your parameter values. See
        L{ParameterManager.passesConstraints}.
    
    @keyword popsize: The number of individuals per parameter in the
        population, if not the default.

    @keyword debug: Set C{True} to override my default I{debug}
        setting and ensure that I show individuals getting replaced.

    @keyword complaintCallback: A callable that my L{Reporter} calls
        with an individual and the non-None result of a complaining
        reporter callback. See L{Reporter.runCallbacks}.

    @keyword targetFraction: Set this to a (small) float to override
        my default target for the total score of improvements in each
        iteration.

    @cvar N_maxParallel: The maximum number of parallel evaluations
        during population L{setup}. Uses an instance of
        C{asynqueue.util.DeferredTracker} for concurrency limiting.
    
    @ivar popsize: The number of individuals per parameter. The
        population size will scale with the number of parameters, up
        until I{Np_max} is reached. Default is 10 individuals per
        parameter.
    
    @ivar Np_min: Minimum population size, i.e., my total number of
        individuals. Default is 20.

    @ivar Np_max: Maximum population size. Default is 500, which is
        really pretty big.

    @ivar targetFraction: The desired total score of improvements in
        each iteration in order for I{ade}'s adaptive algorithm to not
        change the current differential weight. See L{replacement} and
        L{FManager} for details. The default is 3%.

        Three types of calls
        ====================

            The rounded improvement ratio I{rir} indicates how much
            better the challenger is than the individual it
            replaced. I use that ratio to adjust a running score for
            the current iteration to inform the status quo inquiry
            that will occur when the iteration is done, unless I'm not
            running in adaptive mode.
            
            You can set my target I{statusQuoScore} by setting I{sqs}
            to a (small) float value. That will replace my default
            value for future evaluation of replacement individuals.
    
            Finally, a status quo inquiry is a call with no keywords
            set. I will determine if the replacements that occurred
            in the previous generation/iteration were enough to
            warrant maintaining the status quo, and then reset the
            record. You will receive a result of C{True} if the status
            quote should be maintained.

            The status quo should be maintained if several small
            improvements are made, or fewer larger ones, with the
            required number and/or size increasing for a larger
            population. For small populations where even a single
            improvement would be significant, the probability of
            status quo maintenance increases with smaller population
            and will sometimes happen even with no improvements for a
            given generation or iteration.

        Improvement Ratios
        ==================

            An I{rir} of 1 indicates that the successful challenger
            was better (i.e., lower) and not considered equivalent to
            that of the individual it replaced, and that its SSE was
            no better than 1.5x as good (2/3 as high) as the replaced
            individual's SSE. An I{rir} of 2 indicates that the
            challenger had an SSE between 1.5x and 2.5x better than
            (2/5 to 2/3 as high as) the individual it replaced.

            I don't give much weight to an I{rir} of 1. The
            improvement is pretty modest and could be as little as 2%
            (assuming C{Reporter.minDiff}=0.02, the default). An
            I{rir} of 2 gets five times as much weight as that.

            An I{rir} of 3 also gets disproportionately more weight,
            nearly twice as much as I{rir}=2. Beyond that, though, the
            weight scales in a nearly linear fashion. For example, an
            I{rir} of 9 adds just a little more than three times to
            the score (3.67x) as I{rir}=3 does.

            Here's a practical example, with a population of 100
            individuals: If you see 10 "1" characters on the screen
            for one iteration with other 90 being "X," your ratio
            score for that iteration will be 2.5. But if you see just
            one non-X individual with a "8" character, the score will
            be 7.25. That one amazing success story counts far more in
            a sea of failures than a bunch of marginal improvements,
            which is kind of how evolution works in real life. (See
            the literature around "hopeful monsters.")
