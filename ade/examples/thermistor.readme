To see options, run

python thermistor.py -h



The included file thermistor.log is the result of running

python thermistor.py -p 12 -N 8

on an eight-core CPU for about half an hour. Take a look at
thermistor.png to see the final curve fit.

When you run python thermistor.py with no options or your own
selections, you will overwrite thermistor.png. Delete the image file
and run ade-examples again to restore the default if you wish.
